		<h1>Great Staircase</h1>
		<p>Welcome travelers from across the seven seas, to Persepolis, our great kingâ€™s city. Or as the founder of this beautiful city, Darius the great would call it Parsa, or persian city, considering It is now, because of Darius the capital of our Persian Empire. Now if you look this way you will see the Great Staircase at the entrance of the city. Now because persepolis was built on an artificial platform, we need to use these 111 stairs to get to the ground surface of the kings.</p>
