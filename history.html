		<h1>Historical Background of Persepolis</h1>
		<p>Persepolis comes from the Greek name which means “Persian City.”<br><br>
        Actual name of the city was called Parsa which meant “City of the Persians.”<br><br>
        Persepolis was constructed around 515 B.C. by King Darius The Great.<br><br>
        Persepolis was not like a modern day capital city. Mainly a ceremonial city to host festivities.<br><br>
        The city was located in a remote location in the Zagros Mountains in Eastern Iran.<br><br>
        Persepolis was controlled by the Persian Empire also known as the Achaemenid Empire.<br><br>
        Persian Empire expanded from Eastern India to Egypt up through Turkey at its peak.<br><br>
        Persian Empire was established by King Cyrus the Great.<br><br>
        Main hub of the Persian culture and empire was located in the present day countries of Iraq and Iran.<br><br>
        Other capitals of the Persian Empire were Babylon and Susa.<br><br>
        Persian Empire is well known for its fighting and conflict with the Greeks in the Persian Wars. Depicted in the popular film “300.”<br><br>
        Persian kings and empire are brought up multiple times throughout the Old Testament in the Bible.<br><br>
        Right outside of the city of Persepolis are the tombs of some of the great Persian Kings.<br><br>
        Persian Empire started to decline after the death of King Darius.<br><br>
        Alexander the Great was the king of the Macedonian Empire.<br><br>
        Alexander became king at age 20 and conquered the Persian and Egyptian empires within 6 years.<br><br>
        In 330 B.C. Alexander destroyed Persepolis, ended the rule of the Persians.<br><br>
        Conquering of the Persian Empire brought Greek culture and hellenization out East.</p><br><br>
