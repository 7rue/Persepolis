		<h1>Hall of Hundred Columns</h1>
		<p>The hall was a throne hall that was started by Xerxes but finished by his son and successor Artaxerxes. Soon, the building became a store room because the Treasury became too small to hold all the treasures that were brought in. Other historians also suggest that the hall was used for audiences.</p>
