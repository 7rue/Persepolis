		<h1>Palace of Xerxes</h1>
		<p>Now even though Darius started construction of this beautiful city, it was his son that continued it. Which brings us to Xerxes’s Palace. Twice as big as his father’s Palace, this building is truly gorgeous. Although Xerxes had his palace beat out his father’s in size, notice the inscription on the building, “Xerxes, the great king, the king of kings, the son of king Darius, an Achaemenid.”<br>
        Xerxes is always showing love for the parents. Because of the sheer size of this building, it makes it a good hiding place, but Alexander the Great has a special hatred for Xerxes since he overtook Athens.</p>
